# CS111_FreeProject
FreeProject assignment for CS111 Winter 2025



Paper View
For my project, I want to make a to do list app or python code application for BYU students. It will be able to take in calendar events on both canvas and learning suite, as well as take in new events from the user. My code will prioritize events by importance and closeness to due date. I hope it can take in the current date from the user or an important timer and then determine priorities. Here are some initial ideas for the application:

Reads schedule
Organizes by due date and start date
Daily reminders
What is today prompter
Add task prompter
Priority 
Due date
Daily tasks
Organized by priority and due date
Priority changes by task and due date proximity
Opener is saying what day it is
Asks if you want to add tasks, check off task, or see schedule
Tasks are written to file
Also prompts if you want to add a file to initial code 
Careful if you’re creating a file vs appending it 
Check off
Removes from schedule
Tracks completed. 
Scores points based on days before due date (changes) and priority (constant)
If it’s the end of the week, tells you how many points you get
The hardest part of the project will be to take in uniform calendar data from the sites, adding items, removing items, and adjusting priorities based on various factors. Whether it will remain as code in my ide or as an app depends on difficulty and ability as the semester goes on. If any TA has advice for organization or how to implement the idea, I would love the advice.
