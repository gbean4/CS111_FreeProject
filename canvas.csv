We then move on to introduce a new programming paradigm, Functional Programming. We discuss what functional programming is, some of its benefits and drawbacks, and start looking at some of the principles of functional programming such as side effects, pure functions,higher-order functions, and function composition.\n\nOnline Sections\nWatch all of the videos in the tabs.

2025-03-28,event-assignment-1073703,"\n- Free Coding Project Implementation\n \n\n Instructions\n \n\nBy the end of week 12 (after the second midterm), you need to submit your initial work on the project. You don’t have to be done, but you should be making progress. This consists of two parts.\n\nThe first (80 points) is to sit down with a TA (either in person or virtually) and go over the code you wrote, demonstrating what it does and how it works. Part of this will be explaining to the TA how much time you spent on the project and showing them your work log. To get full credit for this part of the project, you need to spend at least 10 hours working on it and you get 8 points per hour spent. Those don’t have to be 10 hours coding. If you needed to learn something new to implement your project, the time spent learning those things counts toward your hours. Just record what you were doing in your work log. If you haven’t spent the full 10 hours yet, you can still receive the points if you put in the time by the end of the semester.\n\nOnce you’ve completed your 10 hours of work and uploaded your work log, the second part (10 points) is [filling out a short reflection questionnaire] (https://byu.instructure.com/courses/27227/assignments/1074484) about your experience working on the project.\n\n \n\n",Free Coding Project Implementation [C S 111 - Winter25]

You should do so (but don’t let it get in the way of your course work). And if you do spend more time on your project, you can earn up to 50 points of extra credit. This is half of a full project which translates to 2% on your final grade in the class.\n\nTo receive the extra credit, you meet with a TA and, just like passing off the initial work, go over the new work you did. You will also need to submit your updated work log showing the extra hours spent on the project. This needs to be done by the last day of classes. The TA will give you 5 extra credit points per hour spent (up to 10 additional hours) working on the project. You can also pass off the required 10 hours at this point as well if you hadn’t gotten them completed at the initial check.\n\nNote that this extra credit will only be applied to your grade if you submit all the required projects. You need to do all the required work before you can get extra credit.\n\n \n\n \n\n",Free Coding Project Extra Credit [C S 111 - Winter25]
